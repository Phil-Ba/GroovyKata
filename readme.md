# Groovy Katas
These Katas provide fun and entertaining ways to learn Groovy and it's features.
You do this, by exploring Unit Tests and finding a way to fix them.
Inspired by [es6katas](https://github.com/tddbin/es6katas.org)

## Goal
Fix the failing Unit Tests.

## Usage
You are not allowed to edit or change the *setup*, *expect* and *then* blocks.
The only things you are supposed to change are the *when* blocks.
